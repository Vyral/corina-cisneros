How will the upcoming presidential election impact real estate?

How is real estate affected by presidential elections?&nbsp;

Research company BTIG has been studying how real estate is impacted by presidential elections since 1963. They determined that during a typical year, during October and November, sales decrease by about 10%. Then they slow down more further into winter. They also concluded that 15% fewer sales happen during this time during election years.&nbsp;

However, those sales aren’t lost. Their studies show that **the year following an election, home sales increase,** which indicates that those who decided not to enter the market simply deferred their plans. Don’t let the election deter you. I don’t have a crystal ball, but economists are saying interest rates should stay low throughout 2020, which will help buyers in the coming months.&nbsp;

Of course, the unknown factor in all of this is the pandemic. That throws a ton of ambiguity into the mix, both before and after the election. In this unusual year, we simply don’t know how things will progress.&nbsp;

If you have any questions about buying, selling, or investing, give me a call or send an email. I look forward to hearing from you.
