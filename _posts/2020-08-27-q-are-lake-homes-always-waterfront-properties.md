<p style="text-align:center;">These are the differences between lake access and waterfront homes.</p>

Are lake homes always waterfront properties? The simple answer is no, but allow me to explain:

This is the New Hampshire Lakes Region because there are so many lakes around here, and each one is different. This means that each lake house is different too. **There are two types of lake properties: lake access and waterfront.** Each of these has its pros and cons both financially and functionally. The most crucial factor is deciding which is best for you and your family.&nbsp;

Commonly lake access homes are part of an association or condominium development. A waterfront property is always a single-family lot, it goes right up to the lake, and you own the land right up to the water. The lake itself is owned by the state, and everyone has a right to enjoy it. Lake access and waterfront differ greatly in the amount of money it takes to buy them. **You pay much more in taxes if you own a waterfront property.** Some houses have a lake view, but no lake access. These things make my job interesting; when sitting down with buyers and sellers, we have to take all these factors into account.&nbsp;

If you’re considering buying a lake home, let’s sit down to discuss which lake, your budget, and which type of property is right for you. If you’re thinking about selling, there’s immense interest in lake houses right now.
