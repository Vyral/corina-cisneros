We pride ourselves in our ability to help our homebuyers succeed at buying homes, but how exactly do we do that?

Before we begin the journey of purchasing a home with our buyers, it’s important that we meet with them in person or via Zoom to hold a discovery session, which allows us to set expectations and understand what buyers really want, as opposed to what you thought you wanted. This is where we’ll also discuss important things like pre-qualification, price ranges, locations, floor plans, acreages, and more so that I can better help you pin down the right home for you.&nbsp;

**Here’s an idea of what to expect from our buyer consultations:**

**&nbsp;1. We’ll look at the market data.** What are prices like? How much inventory is there? What are buyers and sellers expecting in terms of offers? Will there be competition from other buyers?

**&nbsp;2. We’ll go over who you’ll be working with.** I’ll introduce you to the whole team, all of whom work together to help take care of every aspect of the transaction.

**&nbsp;3. We’ll discuss what you can expect from us** in the process in terms of transparency, integrity, and all the values we hold dear. If you’re not seeing those values from us, please tell us so that we can correct it immediately.

**&nbsp;4. We’ll go through the buying process.** According to Zillow, there are 197 steps to the process, but we’ve simplified it because we do it every day.

**&nbsp;5. We’ll talk about the difference between being a customer and a client in New Hampshire.** We work with clients only because that’s the only way we can legally give you advice, counsel, and assistance in negotiations.&nbsp;

**&nbsp;6. We’ll discuss how you can save thousands of dollars.** We’ve helped our clients save up to 4% on the homes they purchased last year and the year before.

You don’t have to take my word for it: Feel free to visit our website, look at our reviews on Zillow, follow our blog, and listen to our radio show “Let’s Talk Real Estate\!” Saturday mornings at 8:30 on WEEI 101.5.
