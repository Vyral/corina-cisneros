<p style="text-align:center;"><em>These are the four things no buyer wants to see in a home these days.</em></p>

**First, let me wish a happy belated Thanksgiving to all of you.** I hope you had a great holiday. Our family did a Thanksgiving Zoom from around the country, and while it was a little strange, all the love and affection was there. Now onto today’s topic: The four most undesirable home features in today’s market.

Many homeowners have lived in their houses for a decade or more. Styles come and go, and it’s important to make your house appealing to the times before you list it. **Here are the four most common undesirable home features that you need to get rid of:**

**1\. Laminate kitchen countertops.** Buyers don’t want them these days. If your whole kitchen is in good shape and you can just replace your laminate countertops, do that. If your kitchen is pretty outdated, you should probably update it.

**2\. Carpet on the main level.** Buyers love hardwood floors and aren’t that fond of carpet, especially on the main level of the home. You can splurge on real wood or get an engineered tile that appears like wood.

**3\. Two-story family room.** Unfortunately, there’s not much you can do about this if you already have a family room with two levels. It’s a lot of wasted space, and you may have to adjust the price a bit because of it.

**4\. Two-story foyer.** Today’s buyers would rather have that extra room for another bedroom or office space.&nbsp;

Other things today’s buyers want to see include a nice yard, good internet, and more outdoor entertaining spaces. I’ll be back soon with another video that goes into further depth on what buyers want.

In the meantime, don’t hesitate to reach out via phone or email. I look forward to hearing from you.
