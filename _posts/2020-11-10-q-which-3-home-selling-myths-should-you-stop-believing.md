<p style="text-align:center;"><em>Ascribing to these three myths will only hurt your home sale.</em></p>

I’ve been speaking with many homeowners lately who seem to believe the same home myths. Here are three such myths that you should stop believing right now:

**1\. If you price it high, buyers will still come.** The reality is that today’s buyers are more educated than ever before, and they have access to a tremendous amount of data through portals like Zillow, Trulia, Realtor.com, etc. By overpricing your home, you’re eliminating those buyers because they either feel your property is outside of their preset price range or their online price filters won’t even show it.&nbsp;

**2\. Open houses attract ready and qualified buyers.** In my experience, it’s rare that this actually happens. In today’s market, buyers primarily rely on the internet because they can get instant notifications from home search websites without seeing multiple homes. Open houses usually attract mostly just neighbors and curiosity-seekers. That’s not to say that they don’t have a place in a marketing plan, but they shouldn’t be relied on as your primary source for attracting buyers.&nbsp;

**3\. You don’t need to prepare your home before listing.** Not preparing your home properly before listing it is one of the worst things you can do as a seller. Not only does this give buyers the wrong impression about your home’s condition, but they’ll often wonder how much more they have to repair if they buy it. Remember, preparing your home for the market doesn’t necessarily mean spending a ton of money.&nbsp;

Even in a seller’s market, it’s important to work with a trusted local Realtor who can help you make the necessary decisions to position your home in the best light possible before putting it on the market.&nbsp;
