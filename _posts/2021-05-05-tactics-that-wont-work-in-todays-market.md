<center>Eight outdated buyer tactics not suited to this crazy hot market.</center>

<center>&nbsp;</center>

In this extremely hot market, buying a home isn’t the same as it was even a year or two ago. Some things need to be readdressed. Here are eight outdated buyer tactics you should forget about using.

**1\. Forget about list prices.** The value at which a home is priced doesn’t mean that's what it will sell for. The list price is a starting point. A house is worth what the buyer and seller are willing to agree on.

**2\. Forget about comps.** The prices of homes are escalating higher than the prices of comparable homes from three to six months ago. Comps are only useful as a data point for the appraiser.

**3\. Forget about what you believe the house is worth.**

**4\. Forget about the appraiser.** Unless you’re aren’t making an offer subject to financing, there will be an appraisal. Right now we’re seeing a lot of cash buyers waiving the appraisal contingency.

**5\. Forget about searching at your maximum price.** Look for homes below your maximum price. Chances are, you’re going to be competing with escalation clauses if you want to win that house.

**6\. Forget about searching for your dream home.** With such low inventory, you can’t afford to take all the time you want. You will likely need to accept a second or third choice house and then make it into your dream home over time.

**7\. Forget about the status quo.** Things like the “buyer love letter” are falling into disrepute. Buyers need to find new ways to separate themselves from the rest. I have a list of things we can do to make your offer stand out and be more attractive.

**8\. Don’t give up.** Tenacity will eventually be rewarded in this market.
