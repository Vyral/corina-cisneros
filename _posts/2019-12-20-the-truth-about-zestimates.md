<center><em>Zillow is a good starting point if you want to know what a home is worth, but it&rsquo;s far from set in stone.</em></center>

<br>I’m back to answer another one of your real estate questions. Ellen from Belmont wants to know, “How accurate is the Zillow Zestimate?” I love Zillow and I work with a ton of buyers who come to me through Zillow. They always want to know about the Zestimate, so here’s what I tell them.

**The Zestimate is Zillow’s best guess of what your home is worth, but in the end it’s still just a guess**. They don’t know about any improvements you’ve made or about your local market in general. They admit themselves that they are never 100% accurate, and most of the time they aren’t even 80% accurate.

**A real estate expert like myself is the one who can give you the true market value for your home**, which is based on your home’s condition and what buyers and sellers are paying for homes like it.

If you have any questions for me about your home’s value or real estate in general, don’t hesitate to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
