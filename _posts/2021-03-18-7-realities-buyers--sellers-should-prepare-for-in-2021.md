Are you still planning on buying or selling in 2021 but haven’t pulled the trigger yet? There’s a lot you need to know about our real estate market. I recently came across an article about seven realities buyers and sellers should prepare for this year that I want to share with you that will help you a lot. Even though we’re nearing the end of March already, these realities persist:

1. Low inventory, high demand, and multiple offers
2. Buyers will pay for overpriced homes
3. Overpriced new investor opportunities
4. Increasingly accelerated transactions
5. Leaseback and post-occupancy after closing
6. Challenging appraisal values
7. Overcrowded and overvalued markets

**You can read the article in its entirety&nbsp;**[**here.**](https://faruqiteam.com/blog/7-realities-your-buyers-and-sellers-should-prepare-for-in-2021/) If you have questions about this topic or would like help preparing for a home sale or purchase, don’t hesitate to reach out to me. I’d love to speak with you.
