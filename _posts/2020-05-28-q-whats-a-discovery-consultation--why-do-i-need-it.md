<p style="text-align:center"><em>Truly, now’s the perfect time to sell. Here’s how I help sellers begin.</em></p>

One of the things I do with my prospective sellers is go to their home and lead what’s called a one-on-one Discovery consultation. This is very important because in today's market, we’re dealing with a lot more moving pieces than usual.&nbsp;

**To set sellers up for success, I need to set expectations about the market**. Together, the seller and I will discuss what’s happening in their neighborhood, town, and county. They also need to understand exactly what kind of house they have, and what type of condition it’s in compared to other homes like it on the market.&nbsp;

The next thing I need to do is understand their motivation; what’s driving them to sell right now? There are many different reasons why a person sells their home, and all are equally valid. That being said, each reason requires a bit of a different strategy, so formulating a game plan ahead of time is key.&nbsp;

Deciding a time frame comes next. Do my sellers need to sell first in order to buy, or can they buy first and then take their time selling? Either approach comes with its own pros and cons and will demand a certain market strategy. Ultimately, it’s a very personal decision, and sometimes there’s no other choice but to sell first. **Selling and buying in tandem is a specialty—a high wire act that requires caution and precision.** I make sure to explain how and why simultaneous buying and selling can either work marvelously or fall apart disastrously so that the seller is fully aware of the process.&nbsp;

After our Discovery consultation, I have to go crunch the numbers, look at all of the comps, and determine what the best price to list that home on the market will be. Right now, with COVID-19, low interest rates, and low inventory, pricing can be one of the trickiest parts of the process. Just the other day, I put a house in Southbound Shores up for sale at noon and it went under agreement in only four hours—sight unseen for, or full price. I’m still in the real estate business because I know what it takes to properly price a home and have it sell for top dollar.&nbsp;

**Even before pricing, the No. 1 decision sellers need to make is who they choose as their Realtor.** Who has the experience to help lead them through the home selling process from start to finish? Who can they trust to account for all of the moving pieces? I’m raising my hand for the job; when you’re ready to sell, call me. Whether in person or through video conferencing, we’ll go over every criteron I’ve mentioned in detail and I’ll answer any questions you have.&nbsp;

In the meantime, if you have questions for me about anything discussed in today’s video, don’t hesitate to reach out via phone or email. I look forward to hearing from you.
