<p style="text-align:center"><em>I’ve sold quite a lot of waterfront homes; here’s the formula for success.</em></p>

Waterfront homes are seldom a must-have item for people. Most often, they’re highly emotional purchases with many different factors involved. **When I’m showing waterfront homes, I pay special attention to what a potential buyer is feeling and what they may be thinking.** What are they envisioning this property as? Are they picturing the perfect summer getaway spot for their family? A full-time residence? Every buyer is different, and that’s why talent and experience are so important to have on your side when selling your waterfront property.&nbsp;

I am fortunate to have sold a significant amount of waterfront and water-access homes on Lake Winnipesaukee, Lake Winnisquam, Lake Waukewan, and many other smaller lakes. With that in mind, who are you going to call? No, not the Ghostbusters; you’re going to call me—someone who knows how to handle these specialized sales from top to bottom! In the meantime, here are three tips to keep in mind when selling waterfront properties:&nbsp;

**1. Understand who you’re selling to.** Demographically speaking, the majority of waterfront homebuyers live within 100 to 200 miles of the destination lake—a two to three hours’ drive usually. Some buyers are going to be snowbirds who spend the summers up here and the winters down south. Others will be weekend warriors from Massachusetts, while others still will be full-time residents of New Hampshire. Keeping all of these facts in mind will help me market your home online appropriately. The goal, of course, is to find people who will fall in the love with your house for the same reason you fell in love with it.&nbsp;

**2. Price it right.** Unless you have a lot of experience and know the pulse of that lake’s market, this can be difficult. The foolproof way to know what your home is worth is to get an appraisal done. Typically, it’s not that expensive, maybe a few hundred dollars. Homes on the water (at least in our market) are priced at $1 million or above⁠— so an appraisal is certainly worth it. As a Realtor, I can reference all the comps that sold around the lake and have a discussion with you about the highlights and shortcomings of your property to arrive at a price range we think is right.&nbsp;

**3. Mind the two curb appeals.** Spend money on the exterior of the home so that when a buyer drives up, they’re impressed. If you have a million-dollar home, it better look like it. Make sure your driveway is well-paved and that your landscaping is in order. Of course, the other curb appeal is on the lakeside. If you have any doubts, take your boat, head out on the water, and view your home from there. From this vantage point, what areas could be improved?

If you or someone you know is thinking about selling a waterfront home, give me a call; I will personally go to your house, sit down with you, and review your home’s features. It’s important that we factor in things like your water line, angle toward the sun, square footage, and slope. Also, if you know someone looking to buy, I can help them as well. Remember: *Mi casa es su casa.* I look forward to hearing from you soon!&nbsp;
