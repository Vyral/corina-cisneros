Some home improvement projects will make your home more appealing to buyers and others will simply be a waste of time and money. The information I’m sharing today comes from the 2019 remodeling impact report from the National Association of Realtors Research Group. There are many enhancements you can make to your house that will get a great return on investment when you sell such as a complete kitchen renovation, updated master suite, a new bathroom, installing hardwood floors, upgrading insulation, closet remodels, and more. Here are the details about a few of the best projects you can execute:

A complete kitchen refurbishment is the most worthwhile project you can undertake. This project has a joy score of 10, meaning that **when buyers walk in, they’re very pleased to see a brand-new kitchen.** A bathroom overhaul has a joy score of 9.3, and you’ll get about 57% of your investment back. The average bathroom revamp in the U.S. is around $35,000, which is a bit high, but it depends on what kind of bathroom you want to create.

Another makeover could be converting the basement into a living area. The average price for this renovation is $46,000, and the joy score is 9.5. **You could also fully repaint the interior of your home,** which has a joy score of 9.8, and you’ll get 52% of your money back.
