*The coronavirus has dominated the news (and our daily lives.) Here’s what you need to know about its effects, from a real estate perspective.*

The white elephant in the room is actually a microbe, and today I want to talk about how we’re protecting our business, our clients, and ourselves during these uncertain times. I won’t be talking about the coronavirus itself today, but there are some great resources on the [CDC website](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/index.html)&nbsp;or [211nh.org](http://211nh.org) for local information in New Hampshire.

The National Association of Realtors has issued some guidelines, which I’d like to talk to you more about today. **Here’s an outline of my discussion, with timestamps so you can skip around to the section(s) you are most&nbsp; interested in:**

2:00 — How the virus has taken away one of my favorite parts of real estate

2:58 — How home viewings are going to work from now on

3:30 — How we’re handling our office meetings going forward

5:05 — Why the way we write contracts won’t change much

7:00 — How are closings going to work?

7:45 — My advice for home sellers in this market

9:30 — More digital solutions during the outbreak from eXp Realty

10:55 — Wrapping things up

If you have any real estate-related questions for me, don’t hesitate to reach out via phone or email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
